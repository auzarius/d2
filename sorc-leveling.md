> Note from the author: When respecing in the 30s and you put as much as you can into Blizzard/Frozen Orb and Cold Mastery, don’t spend your spare points.  Save them so you can put a point into both skills each time you level up.

### Bosses
Duriel - Use a few thawing potions before going in on yourself and your mercenary to allow him to be tanked longer and be easier to defeat.  Use Static Field to damage him down.
Mephisto - Can try to moat trick him, but if not use the mercenary to tank him.
Diablo - Frost Nova to slow him and static him down while the mercenary tanks him.  Do not get cost in the fire breath.
Baal - Basically the same strategy as Duriel, but try to stay out of melee range.

### Gear
- Make Stealth using runes from Countess.  Also make a Leaf if running a fire build.
- After completing the second quest in Act 5, use the runes rewarded from the quest (`Ral + Ort + Tal`) to make the Ancient's Pledge shield which provides a significant boost to resistances.
- Use Cows to farm a Crystal Sword that is either unsocketed.  A four socketed sword cannot drop from normal cows.  Use the Larzuk quest to give it four sockets.  This will be used to make a Spirit Sword. 
- Craft additional runewords such as Lore `Orl + Sol` or Rhyme `Shael + Eth` in Nightmare where possible.  Rhyme can be used on the weapon swap for faster teleport until gear improves.
- Early on for a cheap magic find boost, a three socketed helmet can be socketed with three Perfect Topaz to provide a big boost.
- Lower resist wand can be used in an offhand to help with harder fights.
- In Nightmare items like The Oculus, Skin of the Viper Magi, and Shako can be farmed to improve stats.  Additionally Moser’s Blessed Circle can be used to improve resistances and replace Ancient’s Pledge.

### Notes
A Blizzard Sorceress can be used to farm Andariel, Mephisto, Ancient Tunnels, Mausoleum.
